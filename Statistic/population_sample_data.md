# Population 
A population is the entire set of individuals or objects of interest in a particular study. 
It includes all members of a defined group that we are studying or collecting information on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sample Data
A sample is a subset of the population that is used to represent the entire group.
Sampling involves selecting a group of individuals or observations from the population 
to draw conclusions about the whole population.

# Type of Sample Techniques
# Probability Sampling vs Non Probability Sampling

| **Sampling Type**                   | **Description**                                                                | **Category**             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Simple Random Sampling**          | Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.          | Probability Sampling     |
| **Systematic Sampling**             | Selects every *k*th element from a list after a random start.                  | Probability Sampling     |
| **Stratified Sampling**             | Population is divided into strata, and samples are taken from each stratum.    | Probability Sampling     |
| **Cluster Sampling**                | Population is divided into clusters, then some clusters are randomly selected. | Probability Sampling     |
| **Convenience Sampling**            | Samples are taken from a group that is easy to access or contact.              | Non-Probability Sampling |
| **Judgmental (Purposive) Sampling** | Researcher selects samples based on their judgment about what is typical.      | Non-Probability Sampling |
| **Quota Sampling**                  | Ensures specific characteristics are represented by setting quotas.            | Non-Probability Sampling |
| **Snowball Sampling**               | Existing participants recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances.  | Non-Probability Sampling |
