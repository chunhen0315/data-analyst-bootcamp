# Z Test

Z-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether there's a significant difference between 
sample and population means, or between two sample means. 

- Population standard deviation is known
- Sample size is large 
- Data is approximately normally distributed

One-sample z-test: Compare a sample mean to a known population mean.
Two-sample z-test: Compare two sample means.
Z-test for proportions: Test difference between proportions.

Known mean & std:                   New mean & sample size:
u0 = 168cm std = 3.9                u1 = 169.5 n = 36

CI = 0.95, significant value = 0.05
H0 = u0 = 168cm
H1 = u1 != 168cm
