# T Test

A t-test is a statistical test used to compare means when the sample size is small (typically 𝑛<30) 
and/or the population standard deviation is unknown.

- Population standard deviation is unknown
- Sample size is small
- Data is approximately normally distributed

One-sample t-test: Compare the sample mean to a known or hypothesized population mean.
Independent two-sample t-test: Compare means from two independent groups.
Paired sample t-test: Compare means from the same group at different times (before/after).
