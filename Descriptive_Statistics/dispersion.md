# Measure of Dispersion
Descirbe the **spread or variability** of a dataset. They indicate how much the values in a dataset differ 
from central tendency. 

## 1. Range
= Maximum Value - Minimum Value 

- Simple to calculate
- Sensitive to outliers
- Rough measurement 

## 2. Variance
= (Xi - U)^2 / N 

- Provide precise measure of dispersion
- units are squared of orignal data units
- more sensitive to outliers

## 3. Standard Deviation
= = SQRT( (Xi - U)^2 / N ) > Sqrt of variance 

- Provide clear measure of spread in same unit as the data
- sensitive to outliers

  
## 4. Interquatile Range (IQR)
= Q3 - Q1 > Percentiles 

- Provide meausre of dispersion using different of Q3 and Q1

- less senstive to outliers![Measures-of-Central-Tendency-and-Dispersion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ece2cdca-f6f7-4c19-8456-3bb9e8063197)
