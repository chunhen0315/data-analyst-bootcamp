# Histogram
A histogram is a graphical represenation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimation of 
the probability distribution of a continuous variable, used to visualized the shape, central tendency and variability



## Skewness 
Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a data distribution around its mean.

| **Type**              | **Shape**                          | **Mean vs Median**   | **Example**                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Symmetric (0)**     | Bell-shaped                        | Mean = Median = Mode | Heights of adults                  |
| **Positively Skewed** | Tail on right (values pulled high) | Mean > Median > Mode | Income distribution                |
| **Negatively Skewed** | Tail on left (values pulled low)   | Mean < Median < Mode | Age at retirement (early retirees) |

## Kurtosis
Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the “tailedness” or peakedness of a data distribution.

| **Type**        | **Excess Kurtosis** | **Shape**         | **Tails**                       | **Example**          |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Mesokurtic**  | ≈ 0                 | Normal bell shape | Moderate tails                  | Normal distribution  |
| **Leptokurtic** | > 0                 | Tall, sharp peak  | Fat/heavy tails (more outliers) | Stock market crashes |
| **Platykurtic** | < 0                 | Flat, broad peak  | Thin/light tails                | Uniform distribution |
