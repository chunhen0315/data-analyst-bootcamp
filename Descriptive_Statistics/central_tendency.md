# Measurement of Central Tendency

Central Tendency are statistical metrics that descirbe the **CENTRAL POINT** or typical value of a data set. 
It helps to summarizes a set of data by identifying the central position. 

## 1. Mean
= Xi / N (population/ sample size) 

- affected by extreme outliers
- used when data is symmetrically distributed to provide a mathematical average. 

## 2. Median 
= { 1, 2, **3**, 4, 5 } > Middle Data

- not affected by extreme outliers
- use when data is skewed or contains outliers to better represent the center of skewed data. 

## 3. Mode
= {2, 4, 4, 6, **7, 7, 7**, 9} > Most frequent data

- not affected by extreme outliers
- used for categorical data to identify the most common category.
